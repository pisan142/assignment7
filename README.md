# Assignment 7: University 
## Unit test run tests on Registrar.java, Student.java, and University.java, so make sure not to delete/change date field, the methods' names, signature, or return types. You can change/delete Main.java as you wish.

4. Click on "upload an exsiting file" to choose the .zip file you just download in Step 1 and click on "Commit changes" to submit

- You can also upload the .zip file via "Upload files"

5. Work on the .java file and until you complete
-->

1. Click on Registrar.java, Student.java, and University.java to see what is provided as your starter code. **You must not use other class names or filenames.**
2. Copy the template into your SecretWord.java file in your Java IDE (Repl.It, BlueJ, Eclipse, IntelliJ, jGRASP, etc.) and make your desired edits
    - The name of the classes you are creating **must not be** changed
    - The name of the files you create **must not be** changed
    - You can delete all the code provided by you IDE and just copy the code that you got from java files from GitHub
    - By default, BlueJ uses 4 spaces for indentation. The [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.2-block-indentation) recommends 2 spaces, so we will use 2-spaces for indentation. To change BlueJ's default indentation level see the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuaL1b8MQHg
    - Once you have your indentation level configured properly on BlueJ, use Edit > Auto-Layout to indent your code with 2-spaces.
4. Save your file in your IDE to your local computer and then locate the file and **Upload** your code by clicking the "Add File" button. You can also upload your file using drag-and-drop. **Commit changes** on your browser.
5. Check for test results, errors, and suggestions in "Actions" tab in your browser ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54456351/122830040-a0d55a00-d29c-11eb-8e7f-a73c1a56546d.png)
6. Repeat step 3 and 4 until the assignment is completed and all tests are passed and all code style suggestions are implemented. There are four methods that you have to modify


When committing, GitHub will ask you to enter a commit message. It helps to easily understand why a change has been made to a file at a particular time and distinguish between each commission.<br>

The rest of the README file explains additional concepts about how Actions work.

## Action
Once you're ready to test them, edit the template files and they will be tested using GitHub Actions. 

You'll get 3 kinds of feedback:

1. Checkstyle feedback on code style mistakes in the Google Java Style
2. Misspell report on detected misspellings in your code and comments
3. Unit tests by JUnit, testing if your functions are performing as expected

This is the action page: <br>

The workflow are your commissions from newest to latest. <br>
Click on the one that you want to see the report. <br><br>

The red circle means the workflow is failed. You can see your details in the reports inside it.<br>

The green circle means the workflow is passed, but you should check the reports to check your code style is good enough and any misspell occurs.<br>

## CheckStyle
Click on the left sidebar on "checkstyle" to view the Checkstyle report. <br>
If you have any compilation errors, CheckStyle report will not be generated. Please view the build.txt file and debug all errors first.

### For more detatils on the CheckStyle warning, you can view this website:  <a href="https://pisana.github.io/checkstyle-webpage/">checkstyle-webpage</a>
### If you don't see your warnings on the website, please fill this survey so that we can add them: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1M4lW8zU0gfX2b0JHl3O0-vluhYhtCcvS2Ox0z3LDCwWEHg/viewform">New CheckStyle Warning</a> 

<br><br>

## JUnit Report
Scroll to the bottom and download the artifact to view your detailed test report. <br>
Click "Compile-Run-Report" to download the report. 
It is a zipped folder that will contain a test report and/or a build message file. 
- report.txt: show your scores after running test cases. Getting a 100% score here doesn't guarantee a full score on the assignment. You still need to make sure there are no CheckStyle warnings/annotations.
- built.txt: show errors (only view when there are no results/scores in the report.txt)


You will get the following information in report.txt:
1. Compilation status to check for compilation errors
2. Total score of the your current work
3. Failed/Passed test cases with hints

## What my report.txt is very short with no score? 
This means that there was an error when trying to run tests on your program. Your report.txt file may show some error messages 
that were produced when trying to run our tests. Check to see if your code compiles in your IDE or on the commandline before reuploading.
For more clues to the issue, look in the build.txt file in the zipped folder. 

## What if there's no error messages in my report.txt?
Look in the build.txt file to see build and compilation errors. Some programs can compile but fail to run in unit testing. 
It may be failing due to tests being run on parts of the program that you have not implemented yet.
